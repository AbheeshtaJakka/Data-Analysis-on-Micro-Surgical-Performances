# Data Analysis on Micro-Surgical Performances
 This report is an analysis of a study which explored the relationship between sympathetic arousal and skill in learning micro-surgical tasks.22 students participated in the study and they had five sessions each to perform certain tasks from which their learning and skill is analyzed. Students practiced two micro-surgical tasks Cutting and Suturing on a simulator. After each task they filled a NASA-TLX questionnaire which consists of the responses of the students during those tasks. Baseline is a task where the students are allowed to relax for an hour when the session starts to check the students stress levels in the normal, relaxed environment. Perspiration in the perinasal area is taken into consideration to indicate the stress levels, which usually impair the performance. In general, performance increases upto an extent as the stress increases, that is we tend to perform well in higher stress levels but only till a certain threshold and then, stress levels above that will affect the performance badly. In this report, we mainly analyze if the students had improved their skills over the 5 sessions and what mostly affects their performance.
